# Books Database

This is an app build using python featuring the sqlalchemy module.

This datatbase of books gives the user options to create, read, update and delete book entries of the database. The book entries include the title, author, published date and price. There are also existing sql queries that can be called (stored in variables) and the user can run their own queries.
